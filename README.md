# Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) using the American Community Survey (ACS)

Data are available through the United States Census Bureau website.

I have downloaded the data fro 2008-2015 and used Basemap in Matplotlib in order to create a visualizaion showing the overall increase in health insurance coverage across the United States during the years of the Obama Administration. There is a very dramatic drop in the uninsured population starting in 2014, when open enrollment for the ACA began. Also, it's very clear to see that this occurs in states that are usually "blue" or more liberal-leaning.
